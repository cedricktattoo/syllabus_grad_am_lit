##American Literature and Nature
###Representations of Nature and Culture, 1600s-1850s
![Wilderness Landscape By Edwin Church](wilderness.jpeg)

##Course Description:
This course is a graduate-level introduction to literature from the early-American period to the first decades of the nineteenth century.  In that effort we will also engage in the application of eco-criticism and theory to the body of literature under investigation. 

##Goals:
Over the course of the semester, students will be reading a large variety of texts from the period under investigation and then tease out the ways that ideology and ideological practices of the time effected, and perhaps __affected__, perceptions of reality. Our central goal is to understand the relationships between literary representations of North-American continent and humanity's lived experience as part __of__ nature.

##Requirements:

* __Weekly Reading Assignments__
* __Weekly Blog posts__ --- (500-700 word posts) Posts are due by 9:00am the day of classes
* __Final Project__ --  A "Born Digital" essay of 6000-7500 words, plus media

I would prefer if students used the [Wordpress.com](http://en.wordpress.com/features/) platform for posting blog entries.  The function of the blog posts is to give you a public space to explore ideas that you can share about the literature being read for class.  I intend for the blog posts to be open to the public (Though I would suggest adjusting your settings so that comments are "refereed" before being added to your page).

The last three weeks of class will be an intensive effort to produce a "Born Digital" essay.  By "born digital," we mean an essay that could not exist except in electronic form, otherwise it would not retain the ability to contain or display its content as intended by its creators.  Though students are expected to "turn in" their own individual works, they are nevertheless expected to communicate, brainstorm, collaborate, and be helpful in assisting one another complete their projects.  All of this is in addition to the instructors help and input.  Students should become familiar with the use of [__GitHub__](https://github.com) as a means of maintaining and collaboration for their projects.  Here are some __excellent introductory guides__ for using GitHub:

* [Beginners guide to Git and Github](http://www.webdesignermag.co.uk/features/a-beginners-guide-to-git-and-github/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=pulsenews) --- The best short introduction to Git and Using GitHub for everyday use by non-programming types (like me)
* [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.com/git-guide/) --- An excellent tutorial with __just__ the basics
* [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) --- A full-length, online version of the book which can be purchased on Amazon

Class time will also be dedicated to learning some basic skills to complete the final project.
